## About

Trying to learn C by doing. This is an attempt on a very basic http server that serves static files out of a directory.

## Usage

```sh
docker build -t c-program .

docker run \
-it \
--name c-program-dev \
-v "$(pwd)"/src:/usr/src/myapp/src \
-p 80:80 \
c-program bash

# For subsequent runs
docker start -i c-program-dev

make

./bin/startServer port=8080 dir=./website
```

## Todos

1. Parse header up to /r/n/r/n point and extract target uri and get static file location

2. Create struct to store connection data and set its pointer to epoll_event data \*ptr

- source file descriptor
- \*method
- \*uri
- \*header_field
  - key (strdup)
  - value (strdup)
- header_size
- \*number of bytes sent

3. Use sendfile to send data to client. Close connection once complete. If error EGAIN - continue, if zero means EOF
