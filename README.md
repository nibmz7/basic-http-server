## About

Trying to learn C by doing. This is an attempt on a very basic http server that serves static files out of a directory.

## Usage

```sh
docker run \
-it \
--name c-program-dev \
-v "$(pwd)"/src:/usr/src/myapp/src \
-p 80:80 \
c-program bash

make

./bin/startServer port=8080 dir=./website
```
